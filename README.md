# BotnetV3
Fyi this isn't gonna get updated that much, this is more like a baseplate that you can integrate your own ideas into.

## Installation instructions.

### If you want to run this online instead of on a home network, it is possible, but it is a lot more vunrable. this can be changed in the botClient.js, all you have to do is put the address of the server running the main host.

### You have to put your own bots in the accounts array in the mainHost.js file

> git clone https://github.com/777Portal/BotnetV3

> node mainHost.js

> node botClient.js (as many accounts you have, this is on different computers)

Then just open either the localhost, or if its online, the address of the machine, and enjoy!
